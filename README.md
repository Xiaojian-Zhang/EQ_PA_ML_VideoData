# Data

The training and testing datasets have the same data structure as detailed below:  
1. Each row is an observation and each column is a variable  
2. There are 14 variables (i.e., 14 columns) in total. Please refer to the paper for more details  

A simulated dataset with 5 observations (i.e., demo.csv) is provided as an example dataset to guide readers the data structure.  
For any questions regarding the dataset, please contact xiaojianzhang@ufl.edu
